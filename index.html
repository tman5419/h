<p>A new revolutionary ground breaking invention has been invented! With the creation of the Graphical User Interface it is important to find a means of navigating this new form of UI. The computer mouse does just that. You can use this mouse to navigate the cursor around the screen for even easier use of a computer.</p>

<h2>Ok now some information</h2>

<p><strong>A computer mouse is an electronic device that uses either an optical laser or a ball to determine where to move the cursor on the G.U.I.. When moving the mouse on a flat surface it calculates how far you have moved the mouse. This invention allows you to easily manipulate the cursor on the G.U.I..</strong></p>
<p><strong> This invention was created by Douglas Anglebart with help from Bill English in 1964. The mouse was created while Douglas was working at the Stanford Research institute in Menlo Park, California. Sadly Douglas Anglebart died in 2014 and barely profited off of his own invention.</strong></p>

<h2>How to use the computer mouse yourself</h2>
<p><strong> You use the mouse by moving it on a flat surface and clicking with either of the buttons on the mouse this allows you to select and move things on your screen. The computer mouse is pretty simple to use.</strong></p>
